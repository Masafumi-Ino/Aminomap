# Aminomap
Explore the whole-protein-sequences by entire short segments, create a new amino-map.


Aminomap is a project to search a sequence-space of protein.


The significance of this project is 
1. Possible all aminoacid-patterns searched in whole protein sequence in human and other model animals.
2. Occurence of famous- or rare-aminoacid-patterns in whole protein sequence was assessed as short-segments of 3 - 5 aa.
3. non-utilized sequence-space of aminoacids-pattern was proved


Next purpose is 
1. construct a algorithm to conjugate the short-segments
2. make a new artificial-protien in a non-utilized sequence space
3. New score of protein creates by short-segments occurence

under construction now...
